1. About                                                             *g-about*

Vim-G is a tiny plugin that allows you to perform a quick Google search
directly from Vim. It opens a new browser window with results. Vim-G uses Perl
for URL encoding (except on Windows).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Usage                                                             *g-usage*

To lookup a word (or words) in Google use 'Google' command: >

    :Google hello
    :Google start up

<

'Google' command can use a word under the cursor. Just move the cursor to 
the word and type the same command in the command line: >

    :Google

<

Additionally, you can select words in the visual mode exactly in the same way.
Just select words and type ':Google'. You can also prepend your selection 
with more clues: >

    :Google function
    :Google ruby

<

There is also a special command named 'Googlef' to prepend the current file 
type automatically: >

    :Googlef
    :Googlef strpos
    :Googlef function

<

Moreover, you can use double quotes ('"') to perform
(http://support.google.com/websearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=136861). Just
enclose some words between quotation marks as you type. Also, you don't have
to close manually open quotation marks. Vim-G will add the missing one itself.

Examples: >

    :Google "foo bar"
    :Googlef " help substitute
    :Google foo bar " something else

<

What's even more interesting this also works in the visual mode. Therefore,
you can perform a strict phrase search on selected words. Just select words
and type: >

    :Google "
    :Google "foo bar

<


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Configuration                                             *g-configuration*

There are just a few global variables (options) you may set in the '.vimrc'
file.


                                                        *'vim_g_open_command'*
Default: "xdg-open" (and "open" on Mac OSX)

Sets the command used to open the URL. In case of Ubuntu this would be
"xdg-open": >

    let g:vim_g_open_command = "xdg-open"

<


                                                        *'vim_g_perl_command'*
Default: "perl"

Sets the Perl command. By default it's "perl": >

    let g:vim_g_perl_command = "perl"

<


                                                           *'vim_g_query_url'*
Default: "http://google.com/search?q="

Sets the query URL. By default it points to Google of course, but you might
want to place your favorite search engine there: >

    let g:vim_g_query_url = "http://google.com/search?q="

<
